# Data  -  Runtime Data Directory

> Status: reviewed and refreshed on 2026-05-28.

This directory holds all runtime-generated data for the OrionForge UI. Everything here is created and modified during normal operation  -  it is **not** checked into version control (except for directory structure).

## Key Files

| File | Format | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `memory/vault.jsonl` | JSONL | Append-only memory store  -  each line is a JSON `Memory` record. Supports soft-delete via `deleted_at` field. |
| `memory/faiss/index.faiss` | Binary | FAISS vector index built from vault entries using `all-mpnet-base-v2` embeddings |
| `memory/faiss/index_meta.json` | JSON | Metadata mapping FAISS vector IDs  ->  memory record IDs |
| `user_notes/index.json` | JSON | Master index of all knowledge notes  -  title, scope, timestamps |
| `shared/inbox.jsonl` | JSONL | Email inbox entries fetched via the Inbox tool |

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

All new user data lives under `data/users/{user_id}/`. Each user has their own chats, memory vault, FAISS indexes, notes, settings, profile overrides, prompt overrides, directive overrides, uploads, and trash. The global directories (`chats/`, `memory/`, `uploads/`, `user_notes/`) are legacy pre-tenant paths.

Path routing is handled by `web/user_data.py` which validates user IDs and builds per-user paths. Copy-on-write means profiles, prompts, and directives fall back to the global templates (`profiles/`, `prompts/`, `directives/`) when no user override exists.

## Backup

To back up all agent data, copy this entire `data/` directory. The `memory/faiss/` index can be rebuilt from `vault.jsonl` at any time. Per-user data lives under `data/users/`  -  back up this directory to preserve all tenant data.
