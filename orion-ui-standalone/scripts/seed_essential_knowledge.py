"""Seed the memory vault with essential operational knowledge for all agents.

Every agent sees scope="shared" memories. This script provides the
foundational context every AI needs upon first interaction:
  - What is OrionForge and what am I?
  - How does the system I'm housed in work?
  - What tools do I have and how do I use them?
  - Who built this and why?
  - What are the rules of engagement?

Run once from the orion-ui-standalone directory:
    python scripts/seed_essential_knowledge.py

Safe to re-run — duplicates are caught by the vault's similarity check.
