"""OrionForge MCP — remote, multi-tenant transport.

This is the Phase-2 counterpart to ``orion_mcp.py`` (the local stdio server).
It exposes the *same* tools and prompts over **streamable HTTP**, but resolves a
**per-user** engine for every request instead of a single process-global one, so
one hosted endpoint can serve every website user with their own isolated data.

Design:
  - The tool bodies are shared with the stdio server via
    ``orion_mcp.register_tools(server, get_engine)``. Here ``get_engine`` returns
    a per-user :class:`OrionEngine` whose ``data_dir`` is the same
    ``data/users/<uid>`` directory the web app uses — so the MCP and the app
    read/write the same Memory Vault.
  - The current user for a request is carried in a :class:`ContextVar`
    (``_USER_CTX``). ``stateless_http=True`` keeps each request self-contained so
    the contextvar set by the host's auth wrapper is visible when the tool runs,
    and there is no cross-worker session affinity to manage on Fly.

This module deliberately does **no** authentication or billing — that lives in
``web/app.py`` (which already imports Supabase auth + the credit system) and is
applied as an ASGI wrapper around the app returned by :func:`build_mcp_app`.
